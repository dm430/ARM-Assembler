This is a ARM assembler that has a simpler syntax than the one defined in the ARM architectural manual. This project is still 
heavily under construction and most of the instructions are not supported yet how ever it will slowly get there*. The syntax of 
the assembly language is still under heavy revision and may change from version to version. I will document the the syntax of the 
language and its usages in this readme.

*Note: This project is curently stagnant (I will work on it when I get time). There also needs to be a major refactor of the parser and lexer. 
 There should be more front loading on the lexer to prevent string compairsions from happening in the parser.
