    This is a ARM assembler that has a simpler syntax than the one defined in the ARM architectural manual. This project is still heavily under construction and most of the instructions are not
    supported yet how ever it will slowly get there. The syntax of the assembly language is still under heavy revision and may change from version to version. I will document the the syntax of the
language and its usages in this readme.
